Design History

	This is a brief explanation of the history of this document.


Version 1.0

this was our initial creation of the game where we finalized an idea for the project and implemented the first iteration of our game mechanics



Game Overview

Philosophy

Philosophical point #1

	this game is trying to display the implementation of ml agents in a 3D game environment in a fun and interactive setting. 

Common Questions

What is the game?

the game we have created is called “Good boy” the goal of the game is  for the dog to make it to his treat well the other levels will add obstacles for  dog.

Why create this game?

	We created this game to demo ML agents in a unity environment 

Where does the game take place?

	the game takes place in a field in which dog treats spawn randomly.

What do I control?

	you can control the dog or place the dog treat depending on the level 


What is the main focus?

	the main focus of the game is to teach to ml agent to reach the goal or dog treat 








Gameplay

once the user starts the game a field will spawn along with the treat then the ml agent should attempt to reach the treat upon doing so a point will be added to the score. 
The Game World

Overview

	Provide an overview to the game world.

World Feature #1

	This section is not supposed to be called world feature #1 but is supposed to be titled with some major thing about the world.  This is where you break down what is so great about the game world into component pieces and describe each one.

World Feature #2

	Same thing here.  Don’t sell too hard.  These features should be awesome and be selling the game on its own.

The Physical World

Overview

	a nice open field until obstacles are added in later levels 
Travel

	Describe how the player moves characters around in the world.

Objects

	a cube controlled by the ml agent

              a cube representing the treat



Rendering System



3D Rendering

	we will have chosen to use unity for or rendering and game engine 

Camera

Overview

the game will be in a over world perspective 

Camera Detail #1

	There will be a single camera that will display the word from a birds eye view 


Game Engine

Overview

    we are using unity as the game engine 

Game Engine Detail #1

	the game engine will keep track of the learning brains and ml agents since it is the platform we have been using in class



Collision Detection

	we can add collision detection very easily  thanks to the box collider functions in unity 




Lighting Models

Overview

	we will be using global illumination 

Lighting Model Detail #1

	in layman's terms each object will be radiating light 

Lighting Model Detail #2

	there will be  a light source above the scene illuminating the whole scene and to create realistic shadows 
The World Layout

Overview

	the world will be a simple scene floating in 3d space

User Interface Detail #1

User Interface Detail #2


Musical Scores and Sound Effects

Overview

	upon collecting a treat a dog bark  will play.
 

Single-Player Game

Story

	you are a dog who is hungry for treats you have one goal make it happen

Hours of Gameplay

	the game could be left for hours as the ml agents get better and better each iteration 

Victory Conditions

	the condition for reaching the next level is collecting 30  treats and doing so in lvl 3 will end the game 



Saving and Loading

	since our game will only have 3 levels  we will not have a saving system implemented 

Character Rendering

Overview

	the whole scene or world will be rendered at once including the player character. 

World Editing

Overview
the player will be unable to edit the world's environment other than moving the dog and the treat

 
///////////// to do
